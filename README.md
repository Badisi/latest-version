```

## Usage

__Example__

```js
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
const latestVersion = require('@badisi/latest-version');

(async () => {
    // Single package
    await latestVersion('npm');

    // List of packages

    // Using cache
    await latestVersion('npm@^5.0.2', { useCache: true });
})();
```

__Return__

Either a collection or a single `LatestVersionPackage` object:

```ts
interface LatestVersionPackage {
    /**
     * The name of the package.
     */
    name: string;
    /**
     * The current local or global installed version of the package (if installed).
     */
    installed?: string;
    /**
     * The latest version of the package found on the provided registry (if found).
     */
    latest?: string;
    /**
     * The next version of the package found on the provided registry (if found).
     */
    next?: string;
    /**
     * The latest version of the package found on the provided registry and satisfied by the provided tag or version range (if provided).
     */
    wanted?: string;
    /**
     * The tag or version range that was provided (if provided).
     */
    wantedTagOrRange?: string;
    /**
     * Whether the installed version (if any) could be upgraded or not.
     */
    updatesAvailable: {
        latest: boolean;
        next: boolean;
        wanted: boolean;
    };
    /**
     * Any error that might have occurred during the process.
     */
    error?: Error;
}
```

__Options__

```ts
interface LatestVersionOptions {
    /**
     * Awaiting the api to return might take time, depending on the network, and might impact your package loading performance.
     * You can use the cache mechanism to improve load performance and reduce unnecessary network requests.
     * If `useCache` is not supplied, the api will always check for updates and wait for every requests to return before returning itself.
     * If `useCache` is used, the api will always returned immediately, with either (for each provided packages):
     * 1) a latest/next version available if a cache was found
     * 2) no latest/next version available if no cache was found - in such case updates will be fetched in the background and a cache will
     * be created for each provided packages and made available for the next call to the api.
     *
     * @default false
     */
    useCache?: boolean;

    /**
     * How long the cache for the provided packages should be used before being refreshed (in milliseconds).
     * If `useCache` is not supplied, this option has no effect.
     * If `0` is used, this will force the cache to refresh immediately:
     * 1) The api will returned immediately (without any latest nor next version available for the provided packages)
     * 2) New updates will be fetched in the background
     * 3) The cache for each provided packages will be refreshed and made available for the next call to the api
     *
     * @default ONE_DAY
     */
    cacheMaxAge?: number;
